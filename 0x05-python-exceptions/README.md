# Project 0x05 - Python - Exceptions

## Introduction

In this project, we explore the concept of exceptions in Python. Exceptions are unexpected or error conditions that can occur during the execution of a Python program. Handling exceptions allows us to gracefully deal with errors and prevent program crashes.

## Objectives

- Understand what exceptions are and when they occur.
- Learn how to raise exceptions explicitly using the `raise` statement.
- Implement error handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- Use built-in Python exceptions and create custom exceptions when needed.
- Handle multiple exceptions and specify exception types.
- Properly structure exception handling code.

## Resources

- [Python 3 Documentation - Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
- [Python Exception Handling](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)
- [Python Custom Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions)

## Requirements

- All Python files should be interpreted using Python 3.4.3 (or later).
- The code should follow the PEP 8 style guide.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of exception handling in Python. The tasks may include:

- Handling specific exceptions (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`).
- Raising custom exceptions.
- Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- Implementing unit tests to verify exception handling.
