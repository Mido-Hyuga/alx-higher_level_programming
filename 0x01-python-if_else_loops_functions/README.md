# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Introduction

Welcome to the "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" directory! In this collection of Python projects and exercises, you'll delve deeper into Python programming by exploring conditional statements, loops, and functions. These fundamental concepts are crucial for building more complex Python applications.

## Why Python Programming is Awesome

Python's versatility makes it an excellent choice for a wide range of applications. Learning how to use conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python is a significant step toward becoming a proficient programmer. Python's clean syntax and powerful features make it an enjoyable language to work with.

## Directory Structure

Here are the projects and exercises included in this directory:

1. [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py): A Python script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py): A Python script that prints the last digit of a number.
3. [2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py): A Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
4. [3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py): A Python script that prints the alphabet, excluding certain letters.
5. [4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py): A Python script that prints numbers in hexadecimal format.
6. [5-print_comb2.py](./5-print_comb2.py): A Python script that prints two-digit combinations.
7. [6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py): A Python script that prints three-digit combinations.
8. [7-islower.py](./7-islower.py): A Python function that checks if a character is lowercase.
9. [8-uppercase.py](./8-uppercase.py): A Python function that converts a string to uppercase.

14. [13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c): A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
15. [100-print_tebahpla.py](./100-print_tebahpla.py): A Python script that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between uppercase and lowercase.
16. [101-remove_char_at.py](./101-remove_char_at.py): A Python function that removes a character from a string at a specified position.
17. [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py): A Python function that replicates the behavior of a given bytecode.

## How to Use

Each project directory contains a Python script or C code file with a clear description of its purpose and functionality. You can explore these scripts and functions to learn how to use conditional statements, loops, and functions effectively in Python.

For Python scripts, you can run them using the following command in your terminal:

``bash
python script_name.py


Each project directory contains a Python

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run.

For C code files, you can compile and run them using a C compiler, such as GCC:

``bash
gcc -o output_file input_file.c
./output_file
