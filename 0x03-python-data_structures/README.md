# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, we dive into Python's data structures, specifically lists and tuples. These fundamental data structures are essential in any programming language, and Python provides powerful tools for working with them.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of data structures and their importance.
- Work with Python lists, including creating, indexing, slicing, and modifying.
- Utilize Python tuples, which are similar to lists but immutable.
- Implement common operations and methods for lists and tuples.
- Gain proficiency in handling complex data structures effectively.

## Files

1. **0-print_list_integer.py**: A Python script that prints all integers of a list.
2. **1-element_at.py**: A Python function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
3. **2-replace_in_list.py**: A Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.
4. **3-print_reversed_list_integer.py**: A Python script that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.
5. **4-new_in_list.py**: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
6. **5-no_c.py**: A Python function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
7. **6-print_matrix_integer.py**: A Python function that prints a matrix of integers.
8. **7-add_tuple.py**: A Python function that adds two tuples element-wise.
9. **8-multiple_returns.py**: A Python function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
10. **9-max_integer.py**: A Python function that finds the largest integer in a list.
11. **10-divisible_by_2.py**: A Python function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
12. **11-delete_at.py**: A Python function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
.......

## Usage

You can use these scripts and functions to practice and understand how Python handles lists and tuples. Each file contains a detailed explanation of its purpose and usage.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance these Python scripts to deepen your understanding of data structures in Python.

Happy coding!
