# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Introduction

This directory contains a series of Python projects and exercises that cover fundamental concepts and syntax in Python programming. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your Python skills, these projects are designed to help you get started on your Python journey.

## Why Python Programming is Awesome

Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and more. Learning Python opens up a world of possibilities for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## Directory Structure

Here are the projects and exercises included in this directory:

1. [0-run](./0-run): A Python script that demonstrates how to run a Python script.
2. [1-run_inline](./1-run_inline): A Python script that runs Python code in a single line.
3. [2-print.py](./2-print.py): A Python script showcasing the use of the `print` function to display text.
4. [3-print_number.py](./3-print_number.py): A Python script that prints numbers and demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.
5. [4-print_float.py](./4-print_float.py): A Python script that prints floating-point numbers.
6. [5-print_string.py](./5-print_string.py): A Python script illustrating string manipulation and printing.
7. [6-concat.py](./6-concat.py): A Python script that concatenates two strings.
8. [7-edges.py](./7-edges.py): A Python script that prints specific characters from a string.
9. [8-concat_edges.py](./8-concat_edges.py): A Python script that concatenates specific parts of two strings.
10. [9-easter_egg.py](./9-easter_egg.py): A Python script hiding a fun Easter egg message.

## How to Use

Each project directory contains a Python script with a clear description of its purpose and functionality. You can explore these scripts to understand how different Python concepts are applied.

To run a Python script, you can use the following command in your terminal:

bash
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the Python script you want to run.

## Official Python Coding Style
Python has an official coding style guide called PEP 8. It provides recommendations on how to format your Python code for readability and consistency. While these projects may not strictly adhere to all PEP 8 guidelines, it's a good practice to familiarize yourself with these conventions as you progress in your Python journey.

You can check your Python code for PEP 8 compliance using tools like pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8). Running pycodestyle on your code can help you identify and address style issues.
