- [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/): Conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python.
- [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules/): Working with modules and imports in Python.
- [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures/): Lists and tuples in Python.
- [0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures/): Sets and dictionaries in Python.
- [0x17. C - Doubly linked lists](./0x17-doubly_linked_lists/): Introduction to doubly linked lists in C.
- [0x18. C - Dynamic libraries](./0x18-dynamic_libraries/): Creating and using dynamic libraries in C.
- [0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO](./0x19-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo/): Implementing stacks and queues in C.
