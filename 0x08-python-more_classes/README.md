## How to Use

Each project directory contains a Python script with a clear description of its purpose and functionality. You can explore these scripts to understand how different Python concepts are applied.

To run a Python script, you can use the following command in your terminal:

bash
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the Python script you want to run.

## Official Python Coding Style
Python has an official coding style guide called PEP 8. It provides recommendations on how to format your Python code for readability and consistency. While these projects may not strictly adhere to all PEP 8 guidelines, it's a good practice to familiarize yourself with these conventions as you progress in your Python journey.

You can check your Python code for PEP 8 compliance using tools like pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8). Running pycodestyle on your code can help you identify and address style issues.
