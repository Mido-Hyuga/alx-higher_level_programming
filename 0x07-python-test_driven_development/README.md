# Test-driven development

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about docstrings to create and implement tests in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-add_integer.py` | Function that adds two integers (Doctest on `tests/0-add_integer.txt`) |
| `2-matrix_divided.py` | Function that divides all elemtns of a matrix (Doctest on `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt`) |
| `3-say_my_name.py` | Function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>` (Doctest on `tests/3-say_my_name.txt`) |
| `4-print_square.py` | Function that prints a square with the character `#` (Doctest on `tests/4-print_sqaure.txt`) |
| `5-text_indentation.py` | Function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these `.`, `?` and `:` (Doctest on `tests/5-text_indentation.txt`) |
| `tests/6-max_integer_test.py` | Unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[])` |
| `100-matrix_mul.py` | Function that multiplies 2 matrices (Doctest on `tests/100-matrix_mul.txt`) |
| `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py` | Function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module **NumPy** (Doctest on `tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt`) |
| `102-python.c` | Function that prints Python strings |

## How to Use

Each project directory contains a Python script with a clear description of its purpose and functionality. You can explore these scripts to understand how different Python concepts are applied.

To run a Python script, you can use the following command in your terminal:

bash
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the Python script you want to run.

## Official Python Coding Style
Python has an official coding style guide called PEP 8. It provides recommendations on how to format your Python code for readability and consistency. While these projects may not strictly adhere to all PEP 8 guidelines, it's a good practice to familiarize yourself with these conventions as you progress in your Python journey.

You can check your Python code for PEP 8 compliance using tools like pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8). Running pycodestyle on your code can help you identify and address style issues.
